" # Prodigy_DS_01" 
The first thing I did was to upload my files to GitHub. This is shown as "my first commit"
The next thing I added was my python code to plot the graph.
I used a dataset from https://data.gov.gh/dataset/male-female-population-distribution-age-group-region/resource/b3491523-2e22-4b87-ad36 for my data visualization
I also deleted the old dataset I inttially uploaded it.
